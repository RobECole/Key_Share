# Key_Share

Distributed Systems Major Project

The original inspiration for the project stems from the groups love of playing games with friends on Steam. The idea was to create a way to share games with friends on Steam as you would if you purchased a physical copy of the same game. The project was designed to simulate the exchange of the game keys and the temporary transfer of ownership based on permissions. 

The system is designed to transfer the keys in a peer to peer connection, after being verified and confirmed by a central server. To lend a game the original owner submits a request to loan the game out to another user for a specified amount of time. The central server is responsible for granting permission to access the game and to log all games that are on loan. After the time has expired the server notifies the device in temporary possession of the game is notified that they must return the key. While the key is on loan, the original owner cannot access the game.
